  <br> Specializing in high-quality backend systems, Discord bots, and web applications. </p>

<p align="left">Hi! I'm Ryan - a passionate full-stack developer with a primary focus on Java. Over the years, I've built a wide range of backend services and frontend interfaces, from Discord bots and SaaS platforms to API integrations and web dashboards.

Most of my work has been on private projects, but one of my open-source highlights is <a href="https://github.com/RyanLandDev/Colossus">Colossus</a>, a full-featured framework built on top of <a href="https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld">JDA</a> for rapid Discord bot development.
